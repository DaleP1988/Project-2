Courier exists to make mass email communications an easy and user friendly experience!......  

### Development

Courier was originally developed as a method to send resumes to multiple accounts at once and has evolved into a fully functioning email communications platform that allows users to manipulate a pregenerated HTML template to send to potential employers. Courier can also be used as a marketing tool for promotions and advertising.

### Tech/Frameworks

Courier's frontend is built with Materialize and heavily implements the Google and Gmail APIs for sign-in and authorization.  The MJML framework was used to create the default email template.

Courier has a robust backend built on Node.js and Express servers. Additionally, SQL databases are accessed using Sequelize ORM, and the application is deployed on Heroku.

### Features

Courier outshines the competition with its ability to authorize and send emails directly from users' accounts.  Courier also bypasses a lot of spam filters often associated with mass emails.  Courier also features beautifully designed custom email templates in a variety of colors that appear as-is when sent as email.
